Copyright (c) Team Why Do We Need A Name. All rights reserved.

Game developed for OSGCC.
Pepper Sweeper is a deceptively simple test of memory and reasoning--and is based off of
one of the most popular Windows games of all time. It is so simple that any gastronome
can figure it out.

The object?
Find the empty squares while avoiding the spicy peppers. The faster you clear the 
board, the better your score.

The board
This Game has three standard boards to choose from, each progressively more difficult.
- Beginner: 81 tiles, 10 peppers
- Intermediate: 256 tiles, 40 peppers
- Expert: 480 tiles, 99 peppers

Rules:
- Discover a spicy pepper, and the game ends.
- Discover an empty square, and you keep playing.
- Discover a number, and it tells you how many peppers lay hidden in the 8 surrounding
squares.

Study the patterns..
Explore the unexplored..
And watch out for the spicy peppers.
